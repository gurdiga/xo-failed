* de introdus lista instanţelor de judecată
* how to encode form data?
* static/with options/with suggestions
* fix tests for IE8?
* style: page titles as in the planner prototype


Causality
---------

* why use inputs for labels with options/suggestions? because
  I need autocomplete, and it works only with inputs
* why have names for form elements? to handle radio fields
* why no explicit label binding? this implies IDs, which
  impose limits on acceptable caracters and need slugging
